            <p class="text-muted">India is situated north of the equator between 8°4' north (the mainland) to 37°6'
                north
                latitude and 68°7' east to 97°25' east longitude.[2] It is the seventh-largest country in the world,
                with a
                total area of 3,287,263 square kilometres (1,269,219 sq mi).[3][4][5] India measures 3,214 km (1,997 mi)
                from north to south and 2,933 km (1,822 mi) from east to west. It has a land frontier of 15,200 km
                (9,445
                mi) and a coastline of 7,516.6 km (4,671 mi).[1]

                On the south, India projects into and is bounded by the Indian Ocean—in particular, by the Arabian Sea
                on
                the west, the Lakshadweep Sea to the southwest, the Bay of Bengal on the east, and the Indian Ocean
                proper
                to the south. The Palk Strait and Gulf of Mannar separate India from Sri Lanka to its immediate
                southeast,
                and the Maldives are some 125 kilometres (78 mi) to the south of India's Lakshadweep Islands across the
                Eight Degree Channel. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands, some 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) southeast of
                the
                mainland, share maritime borders with Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia. The southernmost tip of the
                Indian
                mainland (8°4′38″N, 77°31′56″E) is just south of Kanyakumari, while the southernmost point in India is
                Indira Point on Great Nicobar Island. The northernmost point which is under Indian administration is
                Indira
                Col, Siachen Glacier.[6] India's territorial waters extend into the sea to a distance of 12 nautical
                miles
                (13.8 mi; 22.2 km) from the coast baseline.[7] India has the 18th largest Exclusive Economic Zone of
                2,305,143 km2 (890,021 sq mi).

            <p class="text-muted text-capitalize">Politics of India works within the framework of the country's
                Constitution. India is a
                parliamentary democratic secular republic in which the president of India is the head of state & first
                citizen of India and the prime minister of India is the head of government. It is based on the federal
                structure of government, although the word is not used in the Constitution itself. India follows the
                dual
                polity system, i.e. federal in nature, that consists of the central authority at the centre and states
                at
                the periphery. The Constitution defines the organizational powers and limitations of both central and
                state
                governments; it is well recognised, fluid (Preamble of the Constitution being rigid and to dictate
                further
                amendments to the Constitution) and considered supreme, i.e. the laws of the nation must conform to it.

                There is a provision for a bicameral legislature consisting of an upper house, the Rajya Sabha (Council
                of
                States), which represents the states of the Indian federation, and a lower house, the Lok Sabha (House
                of
                the People), which represents the people of India as a whole. The Constitution provides for an
                independent
                judiciary, which is headed by the Supreme Court. The court's mandate is to protect the Constitution, to
                settle disputes between the central government and the states, to settle inter-state disputes, to
                nullify
                any central or state laws that go against the Constitution and to protect the fundamental rights of
                citizens, issuing writs for their enforcement in cases of violation.

        <p class="text-muted text-capitalize">Indian culture, often labelled as a combination of several cultures, has
            been influenced by a history that is several millennia old, beginning with the Indus Valley civilization and
            other early cultural areas.[1][2] Many elements of Indian culture, such as Indian religions, mathematics,
            philosophy, cuisine, languages, dance, music and movies have had a profound impact across the Indosphere,
            Greater India and the world. Specifically Southeast Asian and Himalayan influence on early India, had
            lasting impacts on the formation of Hinduism and Indian mythology. Hinduism itself formed from various
            distinct folk religions, which merged during the Vedic period and following periods.[3] Especially
            Austroasiatic groups, such as early Munda and Mon Khmer, but also Tibetic and other Tibeto-Burmese groups,
            left noteworthy influence on local Indian peoples and culture. Several scholars, such as Professor
            Przyluski, among others, concluded that there is a significant cultural, linguistic, and political Mon-Khmer
            (Austroasiatic) influence on early India, which can also be observed by Austroasiatic loanwords within
            Indo-Aryan languages and rice cultivation, which was introduced by East/Southeast Asian
            rice-agriculturalists using a route from Southeast Asia through Northeast India into the Indian
            subcontinent.[4][5] The British Raj further influenced Indian culture, such as through the widespread
            introduction of the English language,[6] and a local dialect developed.

        <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (listen); 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an
            Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was
            born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next
            four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
            Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
            civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the
            Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
            technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
